This is a JS, HTML, and Css designed calculator built for The Odin Project.

This is my first attempt at adding keyboard support to a web app, as well as,  my first use of SASS.

Orginally I tried to use array methods to create the calculator, but I had difficulty getting the logic to work so I went with a much more basic approach.  

I like to give thanks to github user michaelosman. Looking at his code helped me a lot when I got stuck.
